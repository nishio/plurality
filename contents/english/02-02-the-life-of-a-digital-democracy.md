# The Life of a Digital Democracy

> When we see "internet of things," let's make it an **internet of beings**.<br />
> When we see "virtual reality," let's make it a **shared reality**.<br />
> When we see "machine learning," let's make it **collaborative learning**.<br />
> When we see "user experience," let's make it **about human experience**.<br />
> When we hear “the singularity is near” — let us remember: The **Plurality** is here.<br />
