# What is Plurality?

> "Democracy is a technology. Like any technology, it gets better when more people strive to improve it." - Audrey Tang[^Audrey]

> "Action, the only activity that goes on directly between men without the intermediary of things or matter, corresponds to the human condition of plurality … this plurality is specifically the condition — not only the conditio sine qua non, but the conditio per quam — of all political life." - Hannah Arendt[^Arendt]

In the previous chapter, we discussed the growing conflict between technology - or, more precisely, technology as implemented largely by profit-seeking corporations, and democracy - or, more precisely, democracy as implemented by top-down centralized nation states, and how these two forces seem to be pulling in opposite directions. To develop an approach that moves beyond this toxic binary, it helps to first acknowledge and understand the thing that the two sides have _in common_. This is a complex topic, but in our view a reasonable summary can be made as follows: the thing that the two perspectives we previously labeled "Libertarianism" and "Technocracy" have in common is a **monist view of the world that sees the social world as a two-level structure of "individuals" and a monolith called "society"**.

If one accepts such a framework, the necessity of the two-century-old fight of Jeffersonianism vs Hamiltonianism, markets versus democracy, fear of big government vs fear of big business, and now in our telling technology versus democracy, follows as an almost immediate conclusion. If you believe that the most important categories that count are "individuals" and "society", then politics reduces to a single-dimensional slider that can be shifted left or right to reflect how much emphasis you want to give each one.

Our approach, centered around the idea of **plurality**, rejects this divide and seeks to create a richer framework. Rather than seeing the most important structures as being individuals at one end, and "society" at the other end, we see a diverse and highly intersecting array of organizations of different scopes and different sizes.

Note that this view differs from a historically common approach to adding nuance to the "individuals vs society" divide in a key way: if individuals are points, and groups are circles, **our circles are not concentric**.

Left: a concentric circle view of society, from [a sociology paper in 2004](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Dynamic%2C-Multi%E2%80%90Level-Model-of-Culture%3A-From-the-a-Erez-Gati/50c014cf2c4e5095a49d5315a150cd4491f0cecd). Right: a plural view of society.

Interactions between circles are complex, and much of what is beautiful about our world comes from various interactions - as well as many of our conflicts. Each individual has all kinds of loyalties to all kinds of groups, and efforts to try to strip away this plural loyalty in favor of either unbridled valorizing of self-interest or demanding supreme loyalty to some overarching structure representing "all of society" (or "all of humanity" etc), are the cause of many of the problems that we see today. Profit-making corporations, and the workflows and the technologies that they build, often cause the most damage by stripping away this complexity. Meanwhile, democracy, seeing itself as trying to create a counter-pressure, often ends up making a second punch against these diverse groups and communities by demanding that these workflows and technologies operate in ways determined and standardized at very large scales by a centralized state.

### Defining Plurality

Our vision of Plurality can be described succinctly in three parts:

* **Plurality is here.** The extreme diversity of the ways in which different people interact with the world and with each other, is a deep feature of the human world that cannot be taken away. This is not even something especially particular to humanity: there are deep analogues of similar ideas across the natural sciences.
* **Plurality can be harnessed, but it must be respected.**  The diversity both of us as individuals and of our combinations is like fire: it can warm us, or it can burn us. Difference often is a source of conflict. But much like making our atoms stop would freeze us to death, attempting to smooth out our differences would create a cold and likely brittle society. There is a multi-century long school of philosophy that has attempted to describe and perfect the art of harnessing our diversity as a strength; this school can be revived and pushed much further.
* **Technology must take center stage in Plurality, and plurality must take center stage in technology.** Digital technology is and will be at the center of how we interact with each other, but it will be far better placed to improve the world if works with our diversity, rather than working around it or fighting against it.

Each of the next three chapters will go through one of these ideas in much more detail.
