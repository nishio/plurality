# Trinity Merge

This is a simple JavaScript project that allows the user to control the picking and dropping of lines from three input textareas using keyboard shortcuts.

## Getting Started

Simple HTML and JavaScript project. Just open index.html in your browser.

## Usage

To use hotkeys, you need to focus on small textarea on right bottom corner of the page. It is to avoid conflict with usual textarea editing.
Use 'j', 'k', and 'l' to pick lines from input1, input2, and input3 respectively.
Use 'u', 'i', and 'o' to drop lines from input1, input2, and input3 respectively.
Use Backspace to undo the last drop.
Use Enter to insert new line in output textarea.
